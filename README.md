StartUp Reloaded
===

Hi. I'm a WordPress starter theme for developpers called `StartUp reloaded` based on _s. My goal is to speed up the process of developping a WordPress theme for developpers as well as web designers.

I'm fully loaded with all the things you put together everytime you create a new theme:

* Bootstrap
* Font Awesome
* Options Frameworks
* CMB2
* animate.css
* select2
* animsition
* YTPlayer
* touchSwipe
* waypoint
* Parallax
* Fastclick
* CounterUp
* TGM Plugin Activation
* Hover
* Magnific Popup
* [A bunch of additionnal plugins for custom post types](https://github.com/yozzi?tab=repositories)
